[10pts] Observation Task: Encryption using different ciphers and modes
In this exercise, you will play with various encryption algorithms and modes. You can use the following OpenSSL enc command to encrypt/decrypt a file. To see the manuals, you can type man OpenSSL and man enc


% openssl enc ciphertype -e -in plain.txt -out cipher.bin \ 
-K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff \

-iv 0102030405060708


Please replace the ciphertype with a specific cipher type, such as -aes-128-cbc, -aes-128-cfb, -bf-cbc, etc. Try at least 3 different ciphers and three different modes. You can find the meaning of the command-line options and all the supported cipher types by typing “man enc”. We include some common options for the OpenSSL enc command in the following:

-in <file>	input file
-out <file>	output file
-e	Encrypt
-d	Decrypt
-K/-iv	key/iv in hex is the next argument
-[pP]	print the iv/key (then exit if -P)
	
What to include in your submission for 3.1:
•	Include the plaintext used for encryption
    - Using 3.1words.txt

•	The ciphertext obtained using 3 different encryption modes/algorithms that you tried
    - CBC: 00000000: bfab 4a31 5449 8d09 9cc6 cdf6 1bd5 fd91  ..J1TI..........
    - ECB: 00000000: 05f9 be51 f780 76ea c62c 9cd1 f2e1 c4f1  ...Q..v..,......
    - 00000000: d29c d3cc 0150 f51c 17fc 2e19 767d b0ae  .....P......v}..


•	Include the names of the 3 cipher types
    - AES-128-CBC
    - AES-128-ECB
    - aria-128-cbc
