[10 pts] Observation Task: CBC Encryption using different IVs
IVs or initialization vectors act as a random seed to the block cipher modes of encryption
like CBC. In this task you will understand the role of IVs.
â€¢	Step 1: Create any file with one line of text and name it plain.txt, the content of the file does not matter.
â€¢	Step 2: Now, using the command in the Q3.1, encrypt the file using aes-128-cbc scheme and write the output to the file â€˜encrypt1.binâ€™. You are free to choose the Key and IV in this step but note them down.
â€¢	Step 3: Now using the same Key and IV in the step 2, encrypt the file again and write the output to â€˜encrypt2.binâ€™.
â€¢	Step 4: Now using the same Key in Step 2 and a different IV, encrypt the file again and write your output to â€˜encrypt3.binâ€™.

What to include in your submission for 3.2:
Now based on your observations of the above steps and the 3 different files that you generated, answer the following questions:
â€¢	Do the contents of â€˜encrypt1.binâ€™ match the contents of â€˜encrypt2.binâ€™? Explain why or why not.

â€¢	Do the contents of â€˜encrypt1.binâ€™ match the contents of â€˜encrypt3.binâ€™? Explain why or why not.
