[35pts] How many trials it will take you to break the weak collision resistance property using the brute-force method? 
You should repeat your experiment for multiple times (100 or more depending on how long each trial takes), and report your average number of trials.

    -To break the weak collision resistance property using the brute-force method it was 184.62 trials.
    -To break the strong collision resistance property using the brute-force method it was 179.17 trials.

[35pts] How many trials it will take you to break the collision-free property using the brute-force method? Similarly, you should report the average.
    -The strong collision resistance property represents the collision-free property. The average number of trials required to break the collision-free 
    (strong collision resistance) property using the brute-force method is 179.17 trials.

[10pts] Based on your observation, which property is easier to break using the brute-force method?
    -Based on the output "Strong collision resistance is easier to break than weak collision resistance."

[10pts] Can you explain the difference in your observations? 
    -Weak Collision Resistance: A hash function is weakly collision-resistant if it is hard to find any two distinct inputs that produce the same hash output.
    -Strong Collision Resistance: A hash function is strongly collision-resistant if it is hard to find any two distinct inputs that produce the same hash output, 
    regardless of the input pairs.
