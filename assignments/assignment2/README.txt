-Bloom Filter Implementation
This Python program implements a Bloom Filter for detecting weak passwords based on a list of known passwords from "rockyou.ISO-8859-1.txt" and "dictionary.txt".

-Prerequisites
- Python3 (provided in OSU ENGR Flip)
- The text file `rockyou.ISO-8859-1.txt` containing the list of passwords.
- The text file `dictionary.txt` containing the passwords to test.

-Dependencies
This program requires no external libraries. The built-in Python libraries are sufficient for its operation.

-Usage
1. The `rockyou.ISO-8859-1.txt` and `dictionary.txt` files are in the same directory as this script.
2. Run the script using Python:
    "python3 bloom_filter.py"
